9月13日 闫博士接受玛丽亚·瑞恩博士采访： 我得知，在武汉有大量的病人，并且他们（武汉医院）对新冠病毒的诊断被中共政府给暂时的推迟了，因此报告的病例数字绝对是错误的。所有医护人员都被警告不许谈论此事，他们都十分恐惧，因为他们最清楚这个病毒是有传染性的。而且我们（中共）的政府坚称，没有医生被感染，此后这些被证明这些完全是谎言。

September 13, Dr. Maria Ryan interviews Dr. Li-Meng Yan: I got a lot of intelligence that there are many patients in Wuhan, and their diagnosis of this COVID-19 is postponed very briefly by China government. So the case number are wrong, definitely. The medical staff they are warned not to talk about this, but they're very scared. Because they know this is transmissible. And also our government insisted that there is no medical doctors got infected which was a lie as later was shown.
